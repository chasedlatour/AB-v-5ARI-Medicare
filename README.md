This repository provides analytic SAS code for Zhang, Latour et al. 2023 (submission forthcoming). 

Data for this analysis  come from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Part D Medicare Database, as maintained by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research. This database contains patient information on in-patient, out-patient, and prescription drug service claims among a 20% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries in the United States from 2007-2019. We linked individual-level claims data on the enrollee identification number. All analyses in this study were approved with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Institutional Review Board.

These data cannot be provided publicly but can be obtained through an appropriate data use agreement.

Multiple files are provided with this project and have been substantially commented to facilitate reader understanding. Generally, code is provided for:
(1) Checking code usage across the ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition,
(2) Deriving the patient cohort from Medicare claims files (not the raw files provided by Medicare but derived files at UNC through Cecil G. Sheps Center), and
(3) Conducting analyses.
